hrengin
=======

## What is this?  ##

This is hrengin (formerly hrEngine), a general purpose game engine.

hrengin is based on modular architecture, that is, hrengin consists of several dynamically linked modules, which are intended to be easily replaceable (ideally without recompiling other modules).

*NOTE:* hrengin is only a library, and can not be used alone.

### Status ###

Current version: hrengin-A 1.0


## Dependencies ##

* Bullet physics
* Irrlicht
* OpenAL Soft
* RakNet

However, it is possible to replace any of those with another library, provided you write your own wrapper.

## Compiling ##

Wish you luck!
